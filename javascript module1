 Analysis=
  1. First create a button and give onclick event to it.
  2. When click on button first() will run.
  3. In first() function create three promp and store each prompt velue in variables.
  4. take a Math function max and pass all 3 variables in max function and this function will return maximum value.
  5. Print the value using writeln() function.
  6. take 3 new variables and initialy variables=0;
  7. apply if loop if(number>40) than store the value in new variable. this will done for all 3 variables.
  8. after this add all new variables and store in a variable. this will return the sum of variable which is greater than 40.

  1. take a variable str and store prompt value in this variable.
  2. call check() function by passing str variable in this.
  3. In check function apply a if-else function.
  4. If str==null conditon is true print string is blank else it s not blank.

  1. Take a prompt to take string and store this in a variable.
  2. write string.split(' ') to split string in words using commas.

  Analysis=
  1. Take a string in a variable str.
  2. Use str.substring() function and pass starting and ending index as argument to it , It will return an extracted part of string.
  3. Use slice() similar to this function but slice will take starting index and length of string which we want to extract.
  4. substr() is similar to substring() but if we pass negative index than substr() will extract string from last index while substring() from 0.

  Analysis=
  1. Take an array apply push, pop, shift, unshift methods on it.
  2. pop() method pop the last elemnt of array and  returns the popped element.
  3. push() method push an element at the last of the array and returns new array element. the element is passed as argument.
  4. shift() remove first element of array and return it.
  5. Unshift() adds a new element at the first. returns new array. the element is passed as argument.
  6. delete property deletes an array element by its index, after deleting element space of element is reserved.

  Analisis=
  1. Take two input fields to enter numbers, 4 radio buttons for addition, subtraction , muliply, divide and two buttons one for add,subtract,divide,multiply and 2nd for reset.
  2. give id to all input fields and give value to each radio button.
  3. Apply onclick to calculate button and and when we click on this button calculate() will run.
  4. Inside calculate() get the value of both input fields and store in varibles.
  5. select the button using querySelector() and All rdio buttons using querySelectoreAll().
  6. on clicking on button iterate a loop for all radio buttons and if radio button is checked than store this radio btns value in a variable.
  7. This value pass to a switch statement.
  8. Create 4 cases for Add, sub, mul, div and one default case. write code for all this in each one.
  9. In reset button call reset() onclick of button this will clear all the form data.

  Analysis=
  1. Create a form and give name it inside form create an inout field for date and give id and name to it.
  2. Create a submit button inside form and onclick of button call validatedate() function by passing date field name to it.
  3. In this function create a regx for date.
  4. if date value match with regx than split the date value from '/' and store in a variable.
  5. Find the value of month, day, year by slited string by getting the index.
  6. Take an array and store all month days in it.
  7. if entered date month is 1 or greater than 2 than check that if entered day is greater than 12 print invalid and return false.
  8. if month value is 2 than check for leap year.
  9. If year is devided by 4 and 100 or 400  than it will leap year. 
  10. If year is not leap year and day>=29 than date is invalide.
  11. If year is leap year and day>29 than date is invalide.
  12.  if date value does't match with regx than print invalid date in alert and return false.
